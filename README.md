# TASK-1-COLLECTIONS
a) Create a text file with lines containing some first and last names (let's say it's a list of employees), let this file contain a few of those employees.
b) Please create a program that will read this file (line by line) and save each employee as a separate item in the collection. We need a collection that can be dynamically resized (I suggest ArrayList). Remember to properly handle exceptions and close the stream loading a file (automatic closing can be used).
c) Please print the size of our collection.
d) Please print the contents of the collection in three ways, using: one of the standard loops, the for each loop, and the Iterator interface
